		<h1>Card Sorting For <a href="http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm">NASA's Moon Website</a></h1>
		<p>The tables to display my card sorting go like this: top row are the main pages off the home page and the rows below them are the content on said page.</p>
		<h2>My Sort: </h2>
		<p>Lined up identical to the website because I couldn't blank out my mind on how I saw it and it worked very well.</p>

		<p>When I conducted the card sorting exercise on <a href="http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm">NASA's Moon Website</a> I found that my site architecture was very similar.
			 This was due to their excellent choice of content headers. Had I excluded labeling of what an "Image" section contained it would of lead to putting
			 the image in the wrong seciont. In example in the "About the Moon" tab there was a seciton called "Images" this obviously contains images of the moon to
			 depict information. These images belonged with this seciont so I put in parthenthese (Moon info pics), this helped the user create a better choice on placement.
			 There were others like this that a little more information was need in the description to make a educated assumption.</p>
